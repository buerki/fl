Biography
Early life

Frantz Omar Fanon was born on 20 July 1925 in Fort- de- France  Martinique  which was then part of the French colonial empire  His father  Félix Casimir Fanon  worked as a customs officer  while Fanon s mother  Eléanore Médélice  who was of Afro- Caribbean and Alsatian descent  was a shopkeeper  16  Fanon was the third of four sons in a family of eight children  Two of his siblings died young  including Fanon s sister Gabrielle  with whom he was very close  As they were middle class  his family could __afford to__ send Fanon to the Lycée Victor Schœlcher  the most prestigious secondary school in Martinique  where Fanon came to admire one of his teachers  Aimé Césaire  17 
World War II

After the Battle of France resulted in the French Third Republic capitulating to Nazi Germany in July 1940  Martinique came under the control of French Navy elements __led by__ Admiral Georges Robert who were loyal to the collaborationist Vichy regime  The disruption of imports from Metropolitan France led to major shortages on the island  which were exacerbated by an American naval blockade imposed on Martinique in April 1943  Robert s authoritarian regime repressed local Allied sympathizers  hundreds of whom escaped to nearby Caribbean islands  Fanon later described the Vichy regime in Martinique as taking off their masks and behaving like  authentic racists   18  In January 1943  he fled Martinique during the wedding of one of his brothers and travelled to the British colony of Dominica __in order to__ link up with other Allied sympathizers  19   24 

Robert s regime was overthrown by a local uprising in June of that year  which Fanon would later acclaim as  the birth of the  Martinican  proletariat  as a revolutionary force  After the uprising  Fanon  enthusiastically  returned to Martinique  where Free French leader Charles de Gaulle had appointed Henri Tourtet as the colony s new governor  Tourtet subsequently raised the 5th Antillean Marching Battalion to serve in Free French Forces  FFL   and Fanon soon joined the unit in Fort- de- France  20  21  He underwent basic training before boarding a troopship bound for Casablanca  Morocco in March 1944  After Fanon arrived in Morocco  he was shocked to discover the extent of racial discrimination in the FFL  He was subsequently transferred to a Free French military base in Béjaïa  Algeria  where Fanon witnessed firsthand the antisemitism and Islamophobia of the pieds- noirs  many of whom had supported racist laws promulgated by the Vichy regime  22 

In August 1944  he departed on another troopship from Oran to France as part of Operation Dragoon  the Allied invasion of German- occupied Provence  After the US VI Corps secured a beachhead  Fanon s unit came ashore at Saint- Tropez and advanced inland  He participated in several engagements near Montbéliard  Doubs and was seriously wounded by shrapnel  which resulted in him being hospitalized for two months  Fanon was awarded a Croix de Guerre by Colonel Raoul Salan for his actions in battle  and in early 1945 rejoined his unit and fought in the Battle of Alsace  23  After German forces had been pushed __out of__ France and Allied troops crossed the Rhine into Germany  Fanon and his fellow black troops were removed from their formations and sent southwards to Toulon as part of de Gaulle s policy of removing non- white soldiers from the French army  13  He was subsequently transferred to Normandy to await repatriation  24 

Although Fanon had been initially eager to participate in the Allied war effort  the racism he witnessed during the war disillusioned him  Fanon wrote to his brother Joby from Europe that  I ve been deceived  and I am paying for my mistakes    I m sick of it all   16  In the fall of 1945  a newly- discharged Fanon returned to Martinique  where he focused on completing his secondary education  Césaire  __by now__ a friend and mentor of his  ran on the French Communist Party ticket as a delegate from Martinique to the first National Assembly of the French Fourth Republic  and Fanon worked for his campaign  Staying in Martinique long enough to complete his baccalauréat  Fanon proceeded to return to France  where he intended on studying medicine and psychiatry  citation needed 
France

Fanon was educated in Lyon  where he also studied literature  drama and philosophy  sometimes attending Merleau- Ponty s lectures  During this period  he wrote three plays  of which two survive  25  After qualifying as a psychiatrist in 1951  Fanon did a residency in psychiatry at Saint- Alban- sur- Limagnole under the radical Catalan psychiatrist François Tosquelles  who invigorated Fanon s thinking by emphasizing the role of culture in psychopathology 

In 1948  Fanon started a relationship with Michèle Weyer  a medical student  who soon became pregnant  He left her for an 18- year- old high school student  Josie  whom he married in 1952  At urging of his friends he later recognized his daughter  Mireille  although he did not have contact with her  26 

In France while completing his residency  Fanon wrote and published his first book  Black Skin  White Masks  1952   an analysis of the negative psychological effects of colonial subjugation upon black people  Originally  the manuscript was the doctoral dissertation  submitted at Lyon  entitled  Essay on the Disalienation of the Black   which was a response to the racism that Fanon experienced while studying psychiatry and medicine at university in Lyon  the rejection of the dissertation prompted Fanon to publish it as a book  For his doctor of philosophy degree  he submitted another dissertation of narrower scope and different subject  Left- wing philosopher Francis Jeanson  leader of the pro- Algerian independence Jeanson network  read Fanon s manuscript and as a senior book editor at Éditions du Seuil in Paris  gave the book its new title and wrote its epilogue  27 

After receiving Fanon s manuscript at Seuil  Jeanson invited him to an editorial meeting  Amid Jeanson s praise of the book  Fanon exclaimed   Not bad for a nigger  is it   Insulted  Jeanson dismissed Fanon from his office  Later  Jeanson learned that his response had earned him the writer s lifelong respect  and Fanon acceded to Jeanson s suggestion that the book be entitled Black Skin  White Masks  27 

In the book  Fanon described the unfair treatment of black people in France and how they were disapproved of by white people  Frantz argued that racism and dehumanization directed toward black people caused feelings of inferiority among black people  This dehumanization prevented black people from fully assimilating into white society  and further  into full personhood  This caused psychological strife among black people  as even if they spoke French  obtained an education  and followed social customs associated with white people  they would still never be regarded as French  or a Man  instead  black people are defined as  Black Man  __rather than__  Man    See further discussion of Black Skin  White Masks under Work  below  

Algeria

After his residency  Fanon practised psychiatry at Pontorson  near Mont Saint- Michel  for another year and then  from 1953  in Algeria  He was chef de service at the Blida- Joinville Psychiatric Hospital in Algeria  He worked there until his deportation in January 1957  28 

Fanon s methods of treatment started evolving  particularly by beginning socio- therapy to connect with his patients  cultural backgrounds  He also trained nurses and interns  Following the outbreak of the Algerian revolution in November 1954  Fanon joined the Front de Libération Nationale  after having made contact with Pierre Chaulet at Blida in 1955  Working at a French hospital in Algeria  Fanon became responsible for treating the psychological distress of the French soldiers and officers who carried out torture __in order to__ suppress anti- colonial resistance  Additionally  Fanon was also responsible for treating Algerian torture victims 

Fanon made extensive trips across Algeria  mainly in the Kabylia region  to study the cultural and psychological life of Algerians  His lost study of  The marabout of Si Slimane  is an example  These trips were also a means for clandestine activities  notably in his visits to the ski resort of Chrea which hid an FLN base 
Joining the FLN and exile from Algeria

By summer 1956  Fanon realized that he could __no longer__ continue to support French efforts  even indirectly via his hospital work  In November he submitted his  Letter of resignation to the Resident Minister   which later became an influential text of its own in anti- colonialist circles  29 

    There comes a time when silence becomes dishonesty  The ruling intentions of personal existence are not in accord with the permanent assaults on the most commonplace values  For many months my conscience has been the seat of unpardonable debates  And the conclusion is the determination not to despair of man  __in other words__  of myself  The decision I have reached is that I cannot continue to bear a responsibility at __no matter__ what cost  on the false pretext that __there is__ nothing else to be done 

Shortly afterwards  Fanon was expelled from Algeria and moved to Tunis  where he joined the FLN openly  He was part of the editorial collective of Al Moudjahid  for which he wrote until the end of his life  He also served as Ambassador to Ghana for the Provisional Algerian Government  GPRA   He attended conferences in Accra  Conakry  Addis Ababa  Leopoldville  Cairo and Tripoli  Many of his shorter writings from this period were collected posthumously in the book Toward the African Revolution  In this book Fanon reveals war tactical strategies  in one chapter he discusses how to open a southern front to the war and how to run the supply lines  28 

Upon his return to Tunis  after his exhausting trip across the Sahara to open a Third Front  Fanon was diagnosed with leukemia  He went to the Soviet Union for treatment and experienced remission of his illness  When he came back to Tunis __once again__  he dictated his testament The Wretched of the Earth  When he was not confined to his bed  he delivered lectures to Armée de Libération Nationale  ALN  officers at Ghardimao on the Algerian Tunisian border  He traveled to Rome for a three- day meeting with Jean- Paul Sartre  who had greatly influenced his work  Sartre agreed to write a preface to Fanon s last book  The Wretched of the Earth  30

Death and aftermath

With his health declining  Fanon s comrades urged him to seek treatment in the U S  as his Soviet doctors had suggested  31  In 1961  the CIA arranged a trip under the promise of stealth for further leukemia treatment at a National Institutes of Health facility  31  32  During his time in the United States  Fanon was handled by CIA agent Oliver Iselin  33  As Lewis R  Gordon points out  the circumstances of Fanon s stay are somewhat disputed   What has become orthodoxy  however  is that he was kept in a hotel without treatment for several days until he contracted pneumonia   31 

Fanon subsequently died from double pneumonia in Bethesda  Maryland  on 6 December 1961 after finally having begun his leukemia treatment  although far too late  34  He had been admitted under the name of Ibrahim Omar Fanon  a Libyan nom de guerre he had assumed __in order to__ enter a hospital in Rome after being wounded in Morocco during a mission for the Algerian National Liberation Front  35  He was buried in Algeria after lying in state in Tunisia  Later  his body was moved to a martyrs   Chouhada  graveyard at Aïn Kerma in eastern Algeria

Work

Black Skin  White Masks

Black Skin  White Masks was first published in French as Peau noire  masques blancs in 1952 and is one of Fanon s most important works  In Black Skin  White Masks  Fanon psychoanalyzes the oppressed black person who is perceived to __have to__ be a lesser creature in the white world that they live in  and studies how they navigate the world through a performance of Whiteness  16  Particularly in discussing language  he talks about how the black person s use of a colonizer s language is seen by the colonizer as predatory  and not transformative  which __in turn__ may create insecurity in the black s consciousness  38  He recounts that he himself faced many admonitions as a child for using Creole French __instead of__  real French   or  French French   __that is__   white  French  16  Ultimately  he concludes that  mastery of language  of the white colonizer  __for the sake of__ recognition as white reflects a dependency that subordinates the black s humanity   38 

The reception of his work has been affected by English translations which are recognized to contain numerous omissions and errors  while his unpublished work  including his doctoral thesis  has received little attention  As a result  it has been argued Fanon has often been portrayed as an advocate of violence  it would be more accurate to characterize him as a dialectical opponent of nonviolence  and that his ideas have been extremely oversimplified  This reductionist vision of Fanon s work ignores the subtlety of his understanding of the colonial system  For example  the fifth chapter of Black Skin  White Masks translates  literally  as  The Lived Experience of the Black    L expérience vécue du Noir    but Markmann s translation is  The Fact of Blackness   which leaves out the massive influence of phenomenology on Fanon s early work  39 

Although Fanon wrote Black Skin  White Masks while still in France  most of his work was written in North Africa  It was during this time that he produced works __such as__ L An Cinq  de la Révolution Algérienne in 1959  Year Five of the Algerian Revolution   later republished as Sociology of a Revolution and later still as A Dying Colonialism  Fanon s original title was  Reality of a Nation   however the publisher  François Maspero  refused to accept this title 

Fanon s three books were supplemented by numerous psychiatry articles __as well as__ radical critiques of French colonialism in journals __such as__ Esprit and El Moudjahid 
A Dying Colonialism

A Dying Colonialism is a 1959 book by Fanon that provides an account of how  during the Algerian Revolution  the people of Algeria fought their oppressors  They changed centuries- old cultural patterns and embraced certain ancient cultural practices long derided by their colonialist oppressors as  primitive   __in order to__ destroy the oppressors  Fanon uses the fifth year of the Algerian Revolution as a point of departure for an explication of the inevitable dynamics of colonial oppression  The militant book describes Fanon s understanding that for the colonized   having a gun is the only chance you still have of giving a meaning to your death   40  It also contains one of his most influential articles   Unveiled Algeria   that signifies the fall of imperialism and describes how oppressed people struggle to decolonize their  mind  to avoid assimilation 

The Wretched of the Earth

In The Wretched of the Earth  1961  Les damnés de la terre   published shortly before Fanon s death  Fanon defends the right of a colonized people to use violence to gain independence  In addition  he delineated the processes and forces leading to national independence or neocolonialism during the decolonization movement that engulfed much of the world after World War II  In defence of the use of violence by colonized peoples  Fanon argued that human beings who are not considered __as such__  by the colonizer  shall not be bound by principles that apply to humanity in their attitude towards the colonizer  His book was censored by the French government 

For Fanon in The Wretched of the Earth  the colonizer s presence in Algeria is __based on__ sheer military strength  Any resistance to this strength must also be of a violent nature because it is the only  language  the colonizer speaks  Thus  violent resistance is a necessity imposed by the colonists upon the colonized  The relevance of language and the reformation of discourse pervades much of his work  which is why it is so interdisciplinary  spanning psychiatric concerns to encompass politics  sociology  anthropology  linguistics and literature  41 

His participation in the Algerian Front de Libération Nationale from 1955 determined his audience as the Algerian colonized  It __was to__ them that his final work  Les damnés de la terre  translated into English by Constance Farrington as The Wretched of the Earth  was directed  It constitutes a warning to the oppressed of the dangers they face in the whirlwind of decolonization and the transition to a neo- colonialist  globalized world  42 

An often overlooked aspect of Fanon s work is that he did not like to physically write his pieces  Instead  he would dictate to his wife  Josie  who did all of the writing and  in some cases  contributed and edited  38 

Influences

Fanon was influenced by __a variety of__ thinkers and intellectual traditions including Jean- Paul Sartre  Jacques Lacan  Négritude  and Marxism  12 

Aimé Césaire was a particularly significant influence in Fanon s life  Césaire  a leader of the Négritude movement  was teacher and mentor to Fanon on the island of Martinique  43  Fanon was first introduced to Négritude during his lycée days in Martinique when Césaire coined the term and presented his ideas in Tropiques  the journal that he edited with Suzanne Césaire  his wife  __in addition__ to his now classic Cahier d un retour au pays natal  Journal of a Homecoming   44  Fanon referred to Césaire s writings in his own work  He quoted  for example  his teacher at length in  The Lived Experience of the Black Man   a heavily anthologized essay from Black Skins  White Masks  45 
Legacy

Fanon has had an influence on anti- colonial and national liberation movements  In particular  Les damnés de la terre was a major influence on the work of revolutionary leaders __such as__ Ali Shariati in Iran  Steve Biko in South Africa  Malcolm X in the United States and Ernesto Che Guevara in Cuba  Of these  only Guevara was primarily __concerned with__ Fanon s theories on violence  46  for Shariati and Biko the main interest in Fanon was  the new man  and  black consciousness  respectively  47 

With regard to the American liberation struggle more commonly known as The Black Power Movement  Fanon s work was especially influential  His book Wretched of the Earth is quoted directly in the preface of Stokely Carmichael  Kwame Ture  and Charles Hamilton s book  Black Power  The Politics of Liberation 48  which was published in 1967  shortly after Carmichael left the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  SNCC   In addition  Carmichael and Hamilton include much of Fanon s theory on Colonialism in their work  beginning by framing the situation of former slaves in America as a colony situated inside a nation   To __put it__ another way  __there is__ no  American dilemma  because black people in this country form a colony  and it is not __in the interest of__ the colonial power to liberate them   Ture Hamilton  5   48  Another example is the indictment of the black middle class or what Fanon called the  colonized intellectual  as the indoctrinated followers of the colonial power  Fanon states   The native intellectual has clothed his aggressiveness in his barely veiled desire to assimilate himself to the colonial world   47   49  A third example is the idea that the natives  African Americans  should be constructing new social systems __rather than__ participating in the systems created by the settler population  Ture and Hamilton contend that  black people should create __rather than__ imitate   144   48

The Black Power group that Fanon had the most influence on was the Black Panther Party  BPP   In 1970 Bobby Seale  the Chairman of the BPP  published a collection of recorded observations made while he was incarcerated entitled Seize the Time  The Story of the Black Panther Party and Huey P  Newton  50  This book  while not an academic text  is a primary source chronicling the history of the BPP through the eyes of one of its founders  While describing one of his first meetings with Huey P  Newton  Seale describes bringing him a copy of Wretched of the Earth  There are __at least__ three other direct references to the book  all of them mentioning ways in which the book was influential and how it was included in the curriculum required of all new BPP members  Beyond just reading the text  Seale and the BPP included much of the work in their party platform  The Panther 10 Point Plan contained six points which either directly or indirectly referenced ideas in Fanon s work  these six points included their contention that there must be an end to the  robbery by the white man   and  education that teaches us our true history and our role in present day society   67   50  One of the most important elements adopted by the BPP was the need to build the  humanity  of the native  Fanon claimed that the realization by the native that s he was human would mark the beginning of the push for freedom  33   49  The BPP embraced this idea through the work of their Community Schools and Free Breakfast Programs 

Bolivian indianist Fausto Reinaga also had some Fanon influence and he mentions The Wretched of the Earth in his magnum opus La Revolución India  advocating for decolonisation of native South Americans from European influence  In 2015  Raúl Zibechi argued that Fanon had become a key figure for the Latin American left  51  In August 2021 Fanon s book Voices of liberation was one of those brought by Elisa Loncón to the new  plurinational library  of the Constitutional Convention of Chile  52 

Fanon s influence extended to the liberation movements of the Palestinians  the Tamils  African Americans and others  His work was a key influence on the Black Panther Party  particularly his ideas concerning nationalism  violence and the lumpenproletariat  More recently  radical South African poor people s movements  __such as__ Abahlali baseMjondolo  meaning  people who live in shacks  in Zulu   have been influenced by Fanon s work  53  His work was a key influence on Brazilian educationist Paulo Freire  __as well__ 

Fanon has also profoundly affected contemporary African literature  His work serves as an important theoretical gloss for writers including Ghana s Ayi Kwei Armah  Senegal s Ken Bugul and Ousmane Sembène  Zimbabwe s Tsitsi Dangarembga  and Kenya s Ngũgĩ wa Thiong o  Ngũgĩ goes __so far__ to argue in Decolonizing the Mind  1992  that it is  impossible to understand what informs African writing  without reading Fanon s Wretched of the Earth  54 

The Caribbean Philosophical Association offers the Frantz Fanon Prize for work that furthers the decolonization and liberation of mankind  55 

Fanon s writings on black sexuality in Black Skin  White Masks have garnered critical attention by __a number of__ academics and queer theory scholars  Interrogating Fanon s perspective on the nature of black homosexuality and masculinity  queer theory academics have offered __a variety of__ critical responses to Fanon s words  balancing his position within postcolonial studies with his influence on the formation of contemporary black queer theory  56  57  58  59  60  61 

Fanon s legacy has expanded even further into Black Studies and more specifically  into the theories of Afro- pessimism and Black Critical Theory  Thinkers __such as__ Sylvia Wynter  David Marriott  Frank B  Wilderson III  Jared Sexton  Calvin Warren  and Zakkiyah Iman Jackson have taken up Fanon s ontological  phenomenological  and psychoanalytic analyses of the Negro and the  zone of non- being  __in order to__ develop theories of anti- Blackness  Putting Fanon in conversation with prominent thinkers __such as__ Sylvia Wynter  Saidiya Hartman  and Hortense Spillers  and focusing primarily on the Charles Lam Markmann translation of Black Skin  White Masks  Black Critical Theorists and Afropessimists take seriously the ontological implications of the  Fact of Blackness  and  The Negro and Psychopathology   formulating the Black or the Slave as the non- relational  phobic object that constitutes civil society  62  63  64  65  66  67  68
