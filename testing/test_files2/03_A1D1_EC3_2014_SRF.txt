If students go to the west of America, they can see Yellowstone National Park. There are a lot of beautiful nature and a lot of rare animals. If students go to Miami, they can see Walt Disney World. There are many fantastic amusements and many famous characters, so students must enjoy sightseeing. In addition, students can see many popular places, for example, Grand Canyon,ã€€Statue of Libety, and Times Square. Second, students can improve their English skills.

For example, when students reserve a room at a hotel, they must show their own opinions and hear the statues. However, American may speak quickly because they are used to English, but you must hear and understand. As a result, students can improve their English skills. Students should go to America.
