 second, they can please some people

	one of the main benefits is that they don’t need to eat out
 first, they can save some money
 for example, if they eat out at a restaurant, they may pay about 1,500 yen for a dinner

 it is not healthy
 however, if they cook by themselves, this dish is more low calories
