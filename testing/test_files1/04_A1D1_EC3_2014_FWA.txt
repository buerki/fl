U.S.A is a good country for a vacation
There are some reasons why I recommend this country to you. First, food is very good, and dishes of this country are popular around the world. For example, it is a hamburger, a fried potato and a hot dog. Of course, you can eat these dishes in Japan, but these are different from those of U. S. A.  If you want to eat real dishes of this country, you should go to U.S.A. Second, there are a lot of places to visit in this country. For example, it is Statue of Liberty, Beverly Hills, and Universal Studios Hollywood. In addition, nature is also beautiful. If you like beautiful nature, you should go to Grand Canyon at once.  It is a very famous sightseeing spot. Finally, I think that people in this country is very friendly, so it is easy for you to make friends there. Also, this country has good dancing music, so you can enjoy dance together.  If you talk with them about culture, you can change your mind. Thus, there are a lot of good points to visit this country. If you are interested in this country, you should go to U.S.A at once for your life.
