Australia is a Good Country for a Vacation

	There are number of reasons why Australia is a good country to for a vacation. First, if people visit Australia, they can eat delicious food. The reason is because Australia food is different from Japanese food.  Also, people can rarely eat Australian food in other countries, for example, kangaroos, emus, and crocodiles. These animals just live in Australia, so it is rare to eat. Second, there are beautiful natures in Australia.The first reason is because there are rare animals people can meet in Australia, for example, koalas, kangaroos, and wallabies. Also, people can join a tour to meet these animals where they usually live, so people can enjoy and know more about animals. In addition, Australia has many world heritage sites. For example, people can climb Ayers Rock, people can dive at Great Barrier Reef, and people can ride camels in sand hills. However, when people visit world heritage sites, they need to protect rules to conserve nature. Thus, Australia is a good country for a vacation: people can eat delicious food in Australia, and there are beautiful natures in Australia.
