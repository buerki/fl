If people like sightseeing tour, they can go many famous places, because Italy has 42 world heritage, for example, Colosseo, Trevi Fountain, and San Pietro Temple. If people go to Trevi Fountain, they should throw some coins when they turn to the back. If they throw coins to the fountain, their wish may be granted. The wish varies with number of coins. For example, they can come Italy again, they can spend forever with important person, and they can part from family. If people like soccer, they can go soccer stadium and see Japanese players, for example, Keisuke Honda and Yuto Nagatomo. Although people travel to Milan, they may see Japanese confrontation.
