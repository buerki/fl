Canada is a good country for a vacation
 There are a lot of reasons why Canada is a good country to visit for a vacation because there are lots of nature that we can touch. It is taken Winnipeg city in Manitoba for example in here. First, we can meet wild animals. If we think about meeting animals, weâ€™ll think of zoos to meet them. However, in Canada, we can meet them on the road, in front of the house, or everywhere. So then, what kind of animals can we meet? We can usually meet goose, rabbits and squirrels easily. Also we can meet different kind of birds. Usually goose are seen in the park or on the road. The public road in Canada is wider and bigger than Japanese one so there are enough space to walk for animals and it is not as dangerous as in Japan. They are usually crowd together and are afraid of human, so if we are close to them, they spit at humans to threaten. For rabbits, they are in the bush or in the green but also they are afraid of human, so they hide from us and go away quickly from us even if we find them. For squirrels, they are usually on the trees. Second, we can enjoy skating on the lake. The winter in Winnipeg, the temperature goes minus. The average of it is like -20 to 30 with wind chill. This is why the lake gets frozen in winter. So if we have own skating shoes, we can go free skating. If we do not have the skating shoes, we can go skating because a lot of places are making the link to be able to skate. Thus, if people go to Canada for a vacation, we can meet wild animals, and we can enjoy skating on the lake.
