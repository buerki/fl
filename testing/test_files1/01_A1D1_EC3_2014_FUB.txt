USA is a good country for a vacation
My good country for a vacation is USA. First, there are a lot of shop that we can buy something. Because there are a lot of state in USA., for example, LA, NY, Chicago, and Miami. I can buy verity of thing in LA because my favorite country is USA. Although we have to be careful, when I buy something. USA is worst peace and order than JAPAN. In addition, it is many crime in USA. So, we should have few money into our wallet. Then, we may be able to do shopping in USA. Second, there are many hamburger shop in USA. For example, Fat Burger, Jack in the Box, In-N-Out, and Burger King. However, we have to be careful too eat hamburger because fast food is not good for our body. If you are too eat hamburger, you will be fat men. In fact, there are a lot of fat people in USA.  However, I think that American hamburger is really good. If you will go to America, you should have it.
