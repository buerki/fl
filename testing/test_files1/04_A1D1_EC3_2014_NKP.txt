US is a good country for a vacation
US has two good points for a vacation. First, many kinds of sports are done in US. Especially, I think that one of the most popular sport in US is basketball. Many people who live in US like playing or watching basketball. US
has a big league. The league name is NBA. Do you know NBA, don’t you? NBA is very popular basketball league. It has many basketball teams. For example, Orlando Magic, Chicago Bulls, and LA Lakers. US is the home of basketball. If you visit US, you should watch basketball games. Second, there are a lot of movies all over the world. Some movies are made in US. Some kinds of movies which are made in US are better than other movies because there is “Hollywood” in US. There are some famous actors near Hollywood. For example, Will Smith, Angelina Jolie, and Johnny Depp. If you visit around Hollywood, maybe you can see famous actors or can talk to them, too. That’s why I think that US is a nice place. Therefore US is a good country for a vacation.
