The Benefits of Visiting Australia on a Vacation
There are a number of reasons why Australia is a good country to visit for a vacation. First, weather in this region is mild all the year around, and we enjoy a pleasant life. Because there’re a lot of wild tropical animals, for example, koala and kangaroo, we can spend more time with these animals. Also, Australian enjoy playing sports using effective land, for example, Australian football, rugby, marine sports, and basketball. Therefore, effective land will give us delicious food. Special products of this area are pie, wrap, Tim Tom, and meat. Cultures that food, sports, and animal were born out of rich and favorable climate of the region. Second, we can go on a study tour for world heritage. There is “Christ in Sydney Saint temple”. There, we can learn they believe in Christianity, and there are cultures, art, theatre, and dance. Ordinarily we wouldn’t pay any attention to something like this, but we can discover new. In Australia, there are a lot of tourist spots, and we will have a good day. In addition, we may decide to stay in Australia.
