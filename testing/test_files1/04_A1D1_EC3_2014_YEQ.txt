Vacation in Italy.


Italy is good country for vacation. First, the food is very delicious. Italian cooking is made 

from many kind of materials, for example, cheese, lobster, tomato. There are many 

famous foods in Italy, for example, pizza, pasta, doria. The taste changes by the area. It is 

good to enjoy eating various area`s cooking in vacation. Second, the soccer game is very 

famous all over the world. The national team is strong. They have won the tournament of 

world cup, and the team have been called Catenaccio because defence is very strong. 

Catenaccio means a bolt. The national team`s defence is tough like a bolt. I recommend 

to see the game of soccer if you go to Italy in your vacation.
