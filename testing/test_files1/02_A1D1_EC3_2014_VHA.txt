America is a good country for a vacation
 America has a lot of interesting point for a vacation. First, people can see some sports. I like sports very much because I did the sports very hard. America has a lot of strong sports. For example, track and field, basketball, boxing, and baseball.ã€€My favorite sports is baseball. I like Darvish. He is great baseball player and cool. I want to watch the his game. I think Darvish to outstanding performance this season. Favorite sport to second is boxing. American boxing is very strong. I want to watch the boxing game in Las Vegas. Second, people can eat unique food. For example, big food, and rare food. American food is big volume. I like hamburger so I want to eat American big hamburger, but we need to be careful because fattening. I think American food is good but bad for the health. We need to be careful to eat too much. Thus, if people go to America for a vacation, they can enjoy watch some sports and eat some foods.
