Vacation in Australia 

Vacation in Australia has a number of benefits for me. First, I have never visited abroad, so I experience the first traveling abroad, example I use the plane for about eight or nine hours, and worry about using the plane for many hours. But, I eat “kinaisyoku”, the food served in the plane when someone visited abroad, at first.  Second, Australia has many beautiful landscapes and many cute animals. For example, beautiful landscapes contain to Ayers Rock, Uluru, Great Barrier Reef, and Opera House in night. Also, Ayers Rock is the second biggest rock in the world, and is called “Uluru” by Aborigine, and Great Barrier Reef is the most large coral reef in the world, and is the most famous place in Australia. Then, Opera House is the most famous theater in Australia. In night, around the Opera House, I want to see its illumination with my girlfriend. Then, the cute animal contain to koalas, kangaroos, and Kiwis. The koalas and kangaroos is the marsupial animal, so the koalas and kangaroos raise in its pouch. The Kiwis is the bird which can’t fry in the air, so it is preyed on the foreign animals. In the end, I can’t wait traveling to Australia, but to go to Australia, I must work a part-time job.
